/*

A surface has changed in such a way that it is no longer compatible with the swapchain,
and further presentation requests using the swapchain will fail. Applications must 
query the new surface properties and recreate their swapchain if they wish to continue
presenting to the surface.

VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_PRESENT_SRC_KHR must only be used for presenting a presentable image
for display. A swapchain's image must be transitioned to this layout before calling
vkQueuePresentKHR, and must be transitioned away from this layout after calling
vkAcquireNextImageKHR.

// on the screen. This infrastructure is known as the swap chain and must be created

// waiting to be presented to the screen. The general purpose of the swap chain is to
// synchronize the presentation of images with the refresh rate of the screen.

// 1) Basic surface capabilities (min/max number of images in the swap chain,
//    min/max number of images in the swap chain).
