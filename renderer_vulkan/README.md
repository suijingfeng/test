# vulkan backend info
* codes in this dir is "borrow" from https://github.com/kennyalive/Quake-III-Arena-Kenny-Edition, I convert cpp to c so that it can compile.

* vulkan forder is copied form vulkan sdk, not all items in it is used, it need clean.

* I am a naive programmer, need help, doc and instructions.


# Rendering

## General setup. 

Single command buffer that records all the commands. Single render pass which specifies color and depth-stencil attachment. 
Stencil buffer is used to render Q3's stencil shadows (cg\_shadows=2).

## Geometry. 
Quake 3 renderer prepares geometry data for each draw call in tess.xyz and tess.indexes arrays.
OpenGL backend calls qglDrawElements to feed this geometry to the GPU. 
Vulkan backend appends this data to geometry buffers that are bound to host visible memory chunk.
At the end of the frame when command buffer is submitted to the queue the geometry buffers contain all the geometry data to render the frame.
Typically up to 500Kb of vertex data is copied to the vertex buffer and up to 100Kb of index data is copied to the index buffer per frame.

## Descriptor sets.
For each image used by the renderer separate descriptor set is created.
Each descriptor set contains single descriptor (combined image sampler).
For each draw call either one or two (if lightmap is available) descriptor sets are bound.
Descriptor sets are updated only once during initialization.
There are no descriptor set updates during frame.

## Per-primitive uniform data.
Vulkan guarantees that minimum size of push constants range is at least 128 bytes.
To render ordinary view we use 64 bytes to specify mvp transform.
For portaled/mirrored views additional 64 byte are used to specify eye transform and clipping plane.

Pipeline layout. 2 sets + 128 bytes push constant range.

## Pipelines. 
Standard pipelines are created when renderer starts. 
They are used for skybox rendering, fog/dynamic light effects, shadow volumes and various debug features.
Map specific pipelines are created as part of parsing Q3 shaders and are created during map load.
For each Q3 shader we create three pipelines: one pipeline to render regular view and two additional pipelines for portal and mirror views.

## Shaders.
Emulate corresponding fixed-function functionality. 
Vertex shaders are boring with the only thing to mention that for portaled/mirrored views
we additionally compute distance to the clipping plane. 
Fragment shaders do one or two texture lookups and modulate the results by the color.

## Draw calls. 
vkCmdDrawIndexed is used to draw geometry in most cases. Additionally there are few debug features that use vkCmdDraw to convey unindexed vertexes.

## Code
vk.h provides interface that brings Vulkan support to Q3 renderer. 
The interface is quite concise and consists of a dozen of functions that can be divided into 3 categories: 
initialization functions, resource management functions and rendering setup functions.

### Initialization:

* vk\_initialize : initialize Vulkan backend
* vk\_shutdown : shutdown Vulkan backend

### Resource management:

* images: vk\_create\_image/vk\_upload\_image\_data

* descriptor sets: vk\_update\_descriptor\_set

* samplers: vk\_find\_sampler

* pipelines: vk\_find\_pipeline

### Rendering setup:

* vk\_clear\_attachments : clears framebuffer's attachments.

* vk\_bind\_geometry : is called when we start drawing new geometry.

* vk\_shade\_geometry : is called to shade geometry specified with vk\_bind\_geometry. Can be called multiple times for Q3's multi-stage shaders.

* vk\_begin\_frame/vk\_end\_frame : frame setup.

* vk\_read\_pixels : takes a screenshot.
